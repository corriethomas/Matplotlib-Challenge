# Matplotlib-Challenge
### Studying drug treatments on mice

- Check data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove that data
- Generate summary statistics table consisting of mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen
- Generate a bar plot using both Panda's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of measurments taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study
- Generate a pie plot using both Pandas and Matplotlib that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study
- Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four regimens
- Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by chaning their color and style
- Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor volume vs time point
- Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen
- Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot
